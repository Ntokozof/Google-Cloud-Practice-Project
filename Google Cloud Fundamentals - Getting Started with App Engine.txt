The objective of the lab was the following
•	Initialize App Engine.
•	Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
•	Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
•	Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

I.	In GCP console I opened Cloud Shell.

II.	In the Cloud Shell I used gcloud auth list command to view active account names.

III.	I list the project ID using command gcloud config list project 

IV.	To initialize App Engine in my project I used the command                                                           gcloud app create –project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

V.	I Cloned the source code repository for a sample application                                                               git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

VI.	I navigate to the source directory                                                                                                                cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

VII.	To download and update the packages list I ruined the command                                                 sudo apt-get update

VIII.	To set up a virtual environment where I run the application I used the following command.                                                           sudo apt-get install virtualenv                                
virtualenv -p python3 venv

IX.	To activate the virtual environment I used the command.
source venv/bin/activate

X.	Then I navigated to the project directory and installed dependencies with the command.
pip install  -r requirements.txt

XI.	To run the python application I used the command
python main.py

XII.	In Cloud Shell, click Web preview, Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.

XIII.	To end the test, in Cloud Shell I exicuted Ctrl+C.

XIV.	Using the Cloud Console, verify that the app is not deployed. In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu, click App Engine > Dashboard.

XV.	To get back to the source directory so I can be able to deploy the app I used the command:
cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

XVI.	To deploy application I used.                                                                                                                gcloud app deploy 

Do you want to continue yes and enter as prompted.

XVII.	To launch the browser and view the app I used                                                                                  
gcloud app browse


XVIII.	The app can be viewed in the browser at                                     http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com

XIX.	To undeploy the app under App Engine -> settings I clicked Disable application, enterd the App ID and clicked DISABLE the app is no longer available at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com in the browser.
